<b class="fg-color-blue">What's different about the new test?</b> The TOEFL iBT has a new Speaking section which includes independent and integrated tasks. There is no longer a Structure section. Grammar is tested on questions and tasks in each section. Note taking is allowed throughout the entire test. The speech in the listening material sounds more natural, and one may use a British or Australian accent in one's lecture. There are new questions to measure a speaker's attitude, degree of certainty and purpose. The Reading section has new questions that ask test takers to categorise information and fill in a chart or complete a summary. In the Writing section, typing is required. There is an integrated task in addition to the current independent task, and the scoring guides.

<h3>New Features of the TOEFL iBT	 </h3>
<p>The internet based TOEFL iBT has been modified, elaborating it to test all the four language skills, Reading, Listening, Speaking and Writing.</p>
<p>The test lasts for about four hours. All tests can be conveniently taken in one day. It is conducted over the Internet. Where TOEFL iBT has not been introduced, paper/computer based versions of TOEFL iBT tests can be taken.</p>
<p>The Questions are unique in that they require the test takers to combine more than one skill at a time. They have to speak or write about matters they listen to or read. To be able to combine different language skills with a view to communicate effectively is considered very important for academic success.</p>

<h3>Know TOEFL iBT in detail</h3>
<p>You listen to lectures and/or passages and answer three questions. Some of the questions ask you to speak based on your own experience. Others ask you to speak about the lectures and/or passages.</p>
<h4>In the Speaking section of TOEFL iBT, you will be able to demonstrate your ability to speak about a variety of topics by answering six questions.</h4>
<p>In the test, questions 1 and 2 are  about familiar topics. Your score depends on your ability to speak clearly and coherently about the topics. In questions 3 and 4, your responses are based on what you have read and heard. First you read a short text. Then you listen to a talk on the same topic. You are then asked a question about what you have read and heard. You need to combine appropriate information from the text and the talk to provide complete answer to the question. Your responses to questions 5 and 6 are based on what you have heard. First you listen to part of a conversation or a lecture. You are then asked a question about what you have heard. Your responses to questions 3 and 6 are scored on your ability to speak clearly and coherently and your ability to convery accurate information about what you have read and/or heard. </p>

<p>During the test, you are able to take notes while you are reading and listening to the conversations and lecutres. You may use your notes to help prepare your response. Listen carefully to the directions for each question. The directions are not written on the screen. You are given a short time to prepare your response (15 to 30 seconds, depending on the question). A clock shows how much preparation time is remaining. When the preparation time is up, you are told to begin your response.</p>
<h4>A clock shows you how much time remains. A message appears on the screen when the response time has ended. In these practice questions, you will not record your responses. Instead, you will hear sample responses to a question 2, a question 4 and a question 5.</h4>
<p><b class="fg-color-blue">TOEFL Listening:</b> There are between thirty and fifty questions. There are three types of questions – short conversations; long converstations and class discussions; mini-talks and lectures. The three types of questions are presented in three sets.
